BWHglass
========

This is part of a project under the [Khademhossini Lab](http://www.tissueeng.net/lab/) related to the [organ-on-a-chip](http://www.tissueeng.net/lab/papers/1-s2.0-S0168365914002958-main.pdf) technology. Specifically, the goal of this project was to be able to remotely monitor and control an organ-on-a-chip using Google Glass. This is one of three components of the project:
- A set of LabView scripts to send data to our server
- A server coded with Google App Engine to receive and serve data (This repository)
- A Google Glass app to read the incoming data from the server and visualize it
